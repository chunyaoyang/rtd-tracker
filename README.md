🚆 RTD Personal Tracker

A fast, simple dashboard for Denver's RTD rail and bus system.

🔗 Use the App: https://rtd-tracker.vercel.app/

💡 Why use this?

If you commute in Denver, you know the struggle: Google Maps isn't always accurate, and the official RTD website takes too many clicks to find your train.

RTD Personal Tracker gives you a persistent dashboard:

    Set it up once: Add the specific trips you take every day.

    Instant Info: Open the app and immediately see the countdown for your train.

    No searching: No need to zoom into a map or search for your route every morning.

✨ Key Features

    🎛️ Personal Dashboard: Create a custom list of your daily routes.

    ⚡ Live Countdown: Pulls real-time arrival data directly from RTD.

    🟢 Reliability Check: The status light tells you if the system is actively tracking the train (Green) or if the signal is lost (Red/Grey).

    📱 Phone Friendly: Designed to work perfectly on your mobile browser.
